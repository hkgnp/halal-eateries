# halal-eateries
As of 22nd Feb 2021, there is no proper, public database of Halal eateries in Singapore. [MUIS](https://www.muis.gov.sg/) allows users to search for Halal eateries on their site, but the database is not publicly available.

There may be public interest in making such a data public, and hence this project took a snapshot of the 3,000+ eateries and hosted it on a [public API](https://github.com/hkgnp/halal-eateries-api) for other developers to use.
